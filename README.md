# Quantum Y Gate Demonstration

This repository showcases how the **quantum Pauli-Y gate** acts on six essential quantum states:
**|0⟩**, **|1⟩**, **|+⟩**, **|−⟩**, **|i⟩**, and **|−i⟩**.

The Y gate is a fundamental single-qubit quantum gate defined as:

$$
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It performs a **π rotation around the Y-axis** of the Bloch sphere and introduces complex phase changes in qubit states.

## ⚙️ What Happens When Y Gate is Applied?

The Y gate applies a **90° rotation with phase**. This repository computes:

* **Matrix multiplication** of each input state with the Y matrix.
* **Resulting state vectors** after applying Y.
* **Bloch sphere visualization** (optional future addition).
* **Interpretations** of the transformations.

Example transformation:

```
Y |0⟩ = i|1⟩
Y |+⟩ = i|−⟩
Y |i⟩ = |−i⟩
```
